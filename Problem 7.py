# Assume you have a list of numbers. Write a program that 
# outputs the numbers closest to the 25th and 75th percentile in the 
# data. If there are two numbers identically close, assume the length 
# of the list is divisible by 4. Sample input list of numbers [1 â€¦ 20]. 
# Output 5, 15. 
    
# pseudo code
numlist = list of numbers

function (list):
    Calculate the length of the list
    Sort the list from lowest to highest
    Calculate an index representing half of the length of the list
    Calculate another index representing a quartile
    Write a function that calculates the first quartile
    Write a function that calculates the third quartile
    Print the outputs from these two functions
